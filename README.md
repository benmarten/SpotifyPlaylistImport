SpotifyPlaylistImport
=====================

Mac app written in Swift that reads an XML iTunes playlist export, searches for the songs on Spotify and puts the song URIs in the clipboard

To use it, export your iTunes playlist to XML (File > Library > Export Playlist) and select it within the app. Once it fetched all the track URIs, the whole thing will be copied to your clipboard so it can easily be pasted in Spotify
